# Down the River

A side-scrolling obstacle avoidance game with procedurally-generated map. It is
inspired by the myth of [Romulus and Remus]. Play it on [itch.io]!

This is a submission for the [March/April gamejam] put on by the [Elm Slack]
`#gamedev` channel. The theme was **randomness**.

I also submitted this game to the [Roman Mytholojam] because that's such a cool
theme!
